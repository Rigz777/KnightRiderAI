I always loved Knight Rider growing up. It was the show that made fall in love with technology. 
And now what started as fantasy in the 1980's is closer to reality.

This was my first time trying out nodeJS and dialogflow, while also flexing some front-end knowledge.
At the moment, the A.I is purely conversational.
This is an ongoing project, and I will continue to add some logic to the A.I as until I finally figure out,
If I want it to be purly conversational, or to accomplish specific tasks.
Enjoy!
